### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aditi, a first-year MEng student at Virginia Tech. I've recently completed my B.S. in Computer Science & minor in Human-Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditi-diwan/)! I'm always looking to try new things and learn new tools, so feel free to contact me to collaborate on something! I also keep [this](https://aditi977.github.io/) personal website fairly updated so check it out to see what I'm working on / have recently worked on :).
